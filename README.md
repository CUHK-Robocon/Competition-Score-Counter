# Robocon2021-Score-Counter

Calculating scores with number of arrows might be difficult. This score counter is developed for easy calculation. More details on http://www.robocon2021.com/Rule_Book1.html.

## Description

* UI designed for both laptop and mobile
* Countdown timer feature (for 3 minutes competition time)
* Custom "team name" feature (for recording result with screenshot)
* "Reverse" feature (for mistakenly add arrow to pot)
* Message and score shown (for leading team and Great Victory)
* Sequence feature (for recording arrow shooting order of each team)

## Remark

This is my first project on building a website. The aim is to not only facilitate score counting, but also challenge myself. The website is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript on VS Code. With many resources on w3school and stackoverflow, the overall difficulty is not high. The trickiest part is the UI part but this can be solved by flexbox feature. 

Future development
* combining time counting and sequence features for comprehensive data analysis
* "export screenshot" feature
* making website as Progressive Web App (PWA)
