# Robocon2021-Score-Counter

Calculating scores with number of arrows might be difficult. This score counter is developed for easy calculation. More details on http://www.robocon2021.com/Rule_Book1.html.

## Description

* UI designed for both laptop and mobile
* Countdown timer feature (for 3 minutes competition time)
* Custom "team name" feature (for recording result with screenshot)
* "Reverse" feature (for mistakenly add arrow to pot)
* Message and score shown (for leading team and Great Victory)

## Remark

This is my first project on building a website. The aim of building this website is not only to facilitate score counting, but also to give myself a challenge. The website is built with VS Code and with HTML, CSS, Javascript. With many tutorial resources on w3school and stackoverflow, the overall difficulty is not high. The trickiest part is the UI part but this can be solved by flexbox feature. 
Future development will be combining time counting and sequence features to give a comprehensive data analysis and also "export screenshot" feature.
